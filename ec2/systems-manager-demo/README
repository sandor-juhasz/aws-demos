Launches an EC2 instance with SSM agent enabled in a public subnet
with SSH access.  This demo is a good start if you want to experiment
with Systems Manager and still need direct SSH access to your machine.

After provisioning the stack, open AWS Systems Manager / Managed
Instances and your new instance should appear. Clicking Actions /
Start Session will open a shell.
